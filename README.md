## What is low bandwidth mode

Most of the students are not endowed with a high bandwidth internet connection. These students are then particularly not able to take advantage of realtime online classes. Low bandwidth mode solves this problem by -

- Sending stil images from the live stream every 3 seconds instead of full stream
- To account for lost audio, live transcription will of teacher will be sent to user
